![Alt Text](Customer_churn.jpeg)

# Introduction
#### What is Churn rate?
Churn rate is the percentage of customers who ceased their relationship with a company
#### Why Churn analysis?
Acquiring a new customer is anywhere from five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one. So, the goal of this project is to analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs for the Telecom company

# Data Overview
It is a month's worth of data with the following information for about 10k customers:<br />
#### •	Services that each customer has signed up for:
Phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies<br />
#### •	Customer account information:
How long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges<br />
#### •	Demographic info about customers:
Gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

# Approach
Analyze the impact of the demographics, subscribed services and other account related information in churn rate and identify the reason and kind of people who churn from the telecom services using Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms

# Results
#### Who churned and why?
•	Customers on monthly contracts
•	Customers who opted for Fiber optics internet service incurring higher monthly charges
#### Recommendations
•	Develop economic plans for Fiber optic service
•	Offer discounts to customers opting for yearly contracts
